          Conservation of the environment is one of the four pillars of Bhutan’s
          Gross National Happiness philosophy. As mandated in its constitution
          <q>
            Bhutan preserves (at all times) 60 percent of its land under forest
            cover.</q
          >
          Bhutan has succeeded in doing so. More than 51% of the country is
          protected—the largest percentage of any Asian country. Most of it is
          intact forests interwoven with free-flowing rivers.
        </p>

          Physically, Bhutan can be divided into three zones: Alpine Zone (4000m
          and above) with no forest cover; the Temperate Zone (2000 to 4000m)
          with conifer or broadleaf forests; and the Subtropical Zone (150m to
          2000m) with Tropical or Subtropical vegetation, because of its wide
          altitudinal and climatic range, the flora and fauna is diverse and
          rich.
        </p>

          Bhutan boasts of about 300 species of medicinal plants and about 46
          species of rhododendrons. Some common sights for the visitors are the
          magnolias, junipers, orchids of varied hues, gentian, medicinal
          plants, daphne, giant rhubarb, the blue poppy which is the national
          flower and tropical trees such as pine and oaks.

          A wide range of animal could also be found frequenting the jungles of
          Bhutan. Some high altitude species are the snow leopards, the Bengal
          tigers that are found at altitude ranging 3000 to 4000 meters, the red
          panda, the gorals and the langur, the Himalayan black bear and
          sambars, the wild pigs and the barking deer, the blue sheep and the
          musk deer. In the tropical forests of Southern Bhutan one can come
          across the clouded leopards, the one horned rhinoceros, elephants,
          golden langur that is unique to Bhutan, the water buffaloes and the
          swamp deer.

          Bhutan is also home to about 16 bird species that are endangered
          worldwide. These include the White bellied heron, Pallas Fish eagle,
          Blyth’s King fisher to name a few. Phobjikha valley in Wangdue
          Phodrang and Bumdeling in Trashiyangtse are also two important places
          in Bhutan that is visited by the vulnerable Black-necked Crane.
