      <h2>Flora of Bhutan</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
        The fauna of Bhutan refers to the animal species that live in Bhutan.
        Because of its unique geographical location and relatively well
        preserved natural environment, the fauna of Bhutan is the richest among
        Asian countries of comparable dimensions. There are an estimate of more
        than 160 mammal species. In a narrow tropical and subtropical zone,
        located along the southern border of the Himalayas, the mammals include
        Asian elephant, Indian rhinoceros, gaur, Asian buffalo, hog deer,
        clouded leopard, binturong, barasingha, pygmy hog, bristly rabbit,
        endemic golden langur and the sloth bear and birds - hornbills and
        trogons. In these forests there are snakes, mosquitoes and many other
        insects.

            <h2>Takin</h2>
            Takin are found in bamboo forests at altitudes of 1,000 to 4,500
            metres (3,300 to 15,000 ft), where they eat grass, buds and leaves.
            Takins are diurnal, active in the day, resting in the heat on
            particularly sunny days. Takin gather in small herds in winter and
            herds of up to a hundred individuals in the summer; in winter, they
            move to lower elevations and split into smaller herds of 10–50
            individuals, mostly in the Gasa District. As is often seen in bison,
            old males are often solitary. A study of the Bhutan Takin's seasonal
            movement and habitat use has been conducted by Jigme Dorji National
            Park staff which is thought to be the stronghold of the species in
            Bhutan. An earlier study of its diet on its summer range showed that
            the takin is a generalist browser foraging on numerous shrubs and
            forbs.

            <h2>Birds</h2>
            This is a list of the bird species recorded in Bhutan. The avifauna
            of Bhutan include a total of 750 species, of which one has been
            introduced by humans. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation
            and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature
            (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements
            Checklist of Birds of the World, 2021 edition. The family accounts
            at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the
            species counts found in each family account. Introduced and
            accidental species are included in the total counts for Bhutan. The
            following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The
            commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these
            categories.

            <h2>Butterfly</h2>
            Globally, there are over 550 species, and in Bhutan 42 swallowtail
            butterflies are recorded. Our national butterfly is Ludlow’s Bhutan
            Glory (Bhutanitis ludlowi) which is identified as endangered
            species. Bhutanitis ludlowi is commonly known as Ludlow’s Bhutan
            Glory. It was officially declared as Bhutan’s national butterfly in
            2012. It is found at an altitude of 2000 to 2500 meters asl. It is
            spotted commonly in Trashi Yangtsi Valley during Autumn season.
            Ludlow’s Bhutan Glory (Bhutanitis ludlowi) is listed as endangered
            under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), not
            much was known about the butterfly species until recently. The
            butterfly was first discovered by plant hunters, Frank Ludlow and
            George Sheriff at Tobrang, upper parts of Trashi Yangtse valley in
            1933-34. Commonly seen in Bumdeling valley in Bhutan, Ludlow’s
            Bhutan Glory was rediscovered after 75 years in 2009 by a Bhutanese
            forester, Karma Wangdi. Travelers can visit Trashi Yangtse to see
            these beautiful species.
