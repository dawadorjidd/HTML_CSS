            <h2>Blue Puppy</h2>
            Blue poppies, the national flower, that once grew in abundance at
            the Chelela pass in Paro has been severely depleted in recent years
            according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Nature. "We
            spotted only three flowering and two seedlings at Chelela this June
            and July," said the society's ecologist and ornithologist, Rebecca
            Pradhan. According to the society there were about 150 blue poppies
            in the 1990s. In 2000, the number had dwindled to 20 and to 11 in
            2002.

            <h2>Medicinal Herbs</h2>
            The Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan, located in one of the global
            biodiversity hotspots, is endowed with abundant floral wealth,
            including a wide array of medicinal plants (MPs). However,
            over-exploitation of these resources is widespread, and only a few
            studies have assessed the richness and diversity of Bhutanese
            forests and in particular about the MP resources. A vegetation
            survey was conducted in Tshothang Chiwog, south-eastern Bhutan to
            characterize the floristic structure of the broad-leaf mixed
            coniferous forests with a special focus on MPs

            <h2>Fungus</h2>
            Every year, Bhutanese climb more than 17,000 feet to get a bag of
            cordyceps referred to locally as “Yartsa Goenbub”. Cordyceps
            Sinensis is a rare and powerful fungus found high in the mountains
            of Bhutan. Before the rainy season begins, spores of the Cordyceps
            land on the heads of caterpillars living underground, the fungus
            invades its tiny body and eventually bursts through its head,
            killing it.
